This project employs Map Inversion (inverse distance^4) or kNN techniques for estimating core-based Permeability from NMR well log data. The project involves creating a cross plot of NMR Effective Porosity vs. NMR Free Fluid, integrating core Permeability measurements to refine and enhance Permeability estimations across the entire well. I utilized the Map Inversion program (inv_dist_perm.py) and the kNN program (inv_dist_perm_linux_kNN2.py) for a comprehensive estimation approach. The visualization includes a blue curve indicating estimated permeability and red dots representing core permeability measurements.
